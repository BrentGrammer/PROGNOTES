TUPLES:

Same as Lists except they are immutable and use parens instead of square brackets.


(value, value, value)

-The elements in a tuple may or may not be mutable.

**The contents of the tuple can possible change if the elements are mutable, even though you cannot add, replace or remove individual elements to tuples


1, 2, 3  # Parens are not needed and are just for clarity to the reader in tuples (only a comma between the values is needed)
(1, 2, 3)

Make a tuple with a single value:
1, 
(1,)  # the comma is required after the value to make it a tuple

Empty tuple:
()
