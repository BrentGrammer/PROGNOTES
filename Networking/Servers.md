# Servers

- Specialized OS to handle multi-tasking and multiple users
- tasks are isolated from each other in virtual memory spaces.
- What is more important than clock speed is Multiple Cores.
  - More cores mean more requests can be served at once - hyperthreading means a core can handle more than one (i.e. 2) threads at once so a 4-core hyperthreading system can handle 8 threads.
  - Servers can have more than one processor (so 2 8-core processors means 16 cores can be used or 32 threads with hyperthreading)

  ### Memory
  - anywhere from 32-512GB or more of RAM is possible
