## Wordpress SEO

### SEO (talk by Jim)

- Accessible - google understands site (uses chrome)
- Relevant - use words you want to be ranked for
- Authoritative - links - Some sites do not require a link back (i.e. cnn, bigger websites)

#### Make site that is crawlable

- unique content - cannot be duplicated content
- keyword usage - use multiple times
- Desktop - over 1000 words per page is preferrable
- Mobile - 1000 words should be max
- Sites that answer questions that people search for are given priority (snippets for example will be shown - can set up in Yoast)

\*\*\*schema.org: Google oriented design pattern for better SEO.

- Use most important keywords in title tag and meta description and in the url.
- using just admin in url map attracts hackers - try appending a prefix so it isn't just admin.
- Site Map XML - don't expose pages that are not content rich (maybe keep categories page). Make sure the best pages with lots of relevant content are exposed.

### Keywords

- Long Tail of keywords - keywords targeted should be in the long tail which will be more specific and less broad. You don't want to compete with the top keywords.
  WordTracker - numbers not as good
  Adwords for looking at keyword search volume
- what is the volume and what ads would be associated with them.
- Avoid Bubble language - words that don't help with search ranking.
- Keyword Density - Don't overuse keywords, make them PROMINENT.
- four word phrases are best.

### Linking

- Link to important pages from the homepage
- use sections in the markup
- Image links are not given high ranking.

- Guest post on another site or blog
- Relevant Forums
- Comment links are registered as no follow by google (spamming links in comments does not work or have an affect)
- use 301 redirects fr important domain redirects
- use 302 redirect for unimportant redirects (like blog page).
- have unique content on every product page.
- Duplicating content from Linkedin and Medium is not penalized.
- Popups on first visiting site are penalized by Google.
- AMP: works on blog posts, not static pages. Useful to get traffic on blog posts. Usually used for news sites.
- use subfolders over subdomains.

#### Google adwords: keyword research

### COMMON MISTAKES IN BLOG POST:

1 subheading for every 300 words
-have supporting bullet points for each subheading

### UX/UI Design

4 things to focus on:

- What users need
- What users value
- What users abilities are
- What users limitations are

#### user personas - stories of what your user might be doing during the day (their schedule, what their background is, technical ability, etc.)

address most novice and most advanced ends.
credibility.stanford.edu - study on creating content that users trust and believe.

### TOOLS:

- Sketch: great design program 30 day free trial
- Balsamiq: another wireframing sketch tool (has feature to present the sketch as a pencilled drawing - this works well with people who might think that the first sketch cannot be changes)
  Keep wireframes very barebones.
- Zeplin:
- Invision: for making interactive prototypes - try to push interactive prototypes as far out as possible and don't present it until further into the project.

### Plugins

Jetpack plugin on wordpress - checking into content that draws people

Inspectlet plugin - 500 free a month - shows how people are interacting with your website.

AP Styleguide

Opt-In Monster plugin - monthly fee. provides opt-in feature for users. watch out for popups when starting site load - google penalizes for this.
