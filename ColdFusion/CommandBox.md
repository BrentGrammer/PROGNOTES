- [setup](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/setup)
- [in depth guide](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/getting-started-guide)
- You can make the box.exe available in any Windows terminal by adding its location to the PATH system environment variable. See http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm


### Steps
- Download the CommandBox for your OS (for Windows, it's just the download of the box.exe and optional Java JRE inclusion)
### Windows
- Extract the downloaded zip and run box.exe as administrator (if security notice, click more info > Run Anyway)
  - Creates libraries in .commandbox folder in your user directory
- Optionally move the box.exe (and JRE if with it) to another folder (i.e. C:\commandbox)
- Add the box command to your PATH (User Variables section under advanced system settings)
