# Laws of Exponents and the Natural Log

- See [Python Notebook](./LawOfExponents.ipynb) for code examples

These are 6 very important principles used frequently in proving differentiation properties

## Rules of Exponents:

$x^a \times x^b = x^{a+b}$ <br>

- (If the base is the same, the exponents are added together if the two terms are multiplied)

${x^a \over x^b} = x^{a-b}$ <br>

- Similar to above exept that when we divide, we subtract the exponents from the same base term instead of adding with multiplication
- Note this rule as well which is related: $x^{-b} = {1 \over {x^b}}$

$(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$ <br>

- NOTE: this rule does not always apply - it is true only when the two numbers are positive
  - If x is negative or b is negative, then the rule does not hold

### Natural Log rules

### These rules/properties are true as long as `a` and `b` are GREATER THAN 0

- Note: $\ln$ = Natural Logarithm

$\ln(a \times b) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)$ <br>
$\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)$ <br>
$\ln({a \over b}) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)$
