BLOCKS:

-based on indentation and start with a colon

toplevelblock:
  new block:
    nested block

top level block

Syntax note: you can write lists on multiple lines and Python will not register a new block with indentation:
List = [ value,
         value,
         value ]

use \ to make Python ignore indentation to put other things o ndifferent lines


-----------

f-strings (Python 3.6)
If you use an f-string, you just need to mention the identifiers in curly braces. Also, write �f� right before the string, but outside the quotes used.

print(f"I just printed {x} pages to the printer {printer}")

---------

Multiline statements:

Use a backward slash
print("Hi\
how are you?")
You can also use it to distribute a statement without a string across lines.

a\
=\
10
print(a)


b. Put the string in triple quotes
print("""Hi
       how are you?""")

Python Docstrings

A docstring is a documentation string. Like a comment, this Python Syntax is used to explain code. But unlike comments, they are more specific. Also, they are retained at runtime. This way, the programmer can inspect them at runtime. Delimit a docstring using three double quotes. You may put it as a function�s first line to describe it.

def func():
  """
    This function prints out a greeting
  """
  print(�Hi�)
func()
        
>>> sayhi.__doc__ #prints the docstring

Note: The interpreter is unable to get the docstring to a function if it isn�t the first thing in the python function.

Multiline comments:

"""This comment
is spanned across
multiple lines"""
