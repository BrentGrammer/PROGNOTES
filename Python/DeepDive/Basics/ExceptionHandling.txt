Methods of handling exceptions:

1) Look before you leap
 -Use an if statement to check if operation is possible and else to handle the error (ex. checking if an object is an iterable before iterating over it)

2) Ask for Forgiveness Later:
use a try except block (simply iterate over an object and if it fails go into except block)
