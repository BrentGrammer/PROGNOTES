# Amazon Lightsail
- Virtual Servers, storage and databases networking etc
- Low and predictable pricing
- Simple alternative for people with little cloud experience
- Use cases: 
  - deploy a simple web application, LAMP, MEAN Node etc.
  - Websites (templates for Wordpress Magento etc)
  - Good for Dev/Test environments

- High availability, but no auto scaling - limited AWS integrations
- **Not used today unless a person has no cloud experience and needs something quickly with low pricing and zero config**
