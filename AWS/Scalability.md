Vertical Scaling:
- ex upgrading hardware or a single component - like a t2.micro to a xlarge machine
  - Increasing instance size or decreasing it

Horizontal Scaling:
- Increasing the number of instances/systems for your application
- Implies distributed systems
- Load Balancers and autoscaling groups make scaling easy in AWS
- Scaling out is increasing, scaling in is decreasing

High Availability:
- related to horizontal scaling
- Running your application/system in at least 2 Availability Zones
  - i.e. to survive a disaster or data center failure

Elasticity: a system is scalable but has auto scaling based on load.  Matches demand and is cost omptimized

Agility: not related to scaling - allows for easy access to IT systems that decrease development change time.
