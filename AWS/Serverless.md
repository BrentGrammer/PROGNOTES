SERVERLESS: Paradigm which developers don't have to manage servers

- Just deploy code 
- Anything that is managed - databases message storage etc., by Amazon
- As an end user you do not manage, provision or see the servers.

Examples:
- Amazon S3
- DynamoDB
- Fargate
- Lambda

- Important Cloud principle: Easy to create/provision and delete resources
