# Limits

- The behavior or value of a function as it gets closer and closer to a point with out actually reaching that given value
  - see Zeno's paradox
- The limit is the infinitessimally small point closest to a given value or point

### Notation

$$\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = L$$

$$\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = L$$

- The limit as `x` goes to `a` of the function `f(x)` is `L`
- The plus and minus sign after `a` indicate which direction the limit is being computed for (left or right side on the slope)
  - `+` means approaching from relatively positive values (on the right of the number line)
  - `-` as you approach from relative negative values to the left of `a`
- Note that with limits we are not interested in exactly what happens when `x` = `a`, we're interested in what happens as `x` gets closer and closer to `a`
  - The function `f(x)` goes to `L` as `x` gets closer to `a`
