# Laws of Exponents and the Natural Log

- See [Python Notebook](./LawOfExponents.ipynb) for code examples

These are 6 very important principles used frequently in proving differentiation properties

## Rules of Exponents:

1. (If the base is the same, the exponents are added together if the two terms are multiplied)
   $$x^a \times x^b = x^{a+b}$$

2. Similar to above exept that when we divide, we subtract the exponents from the same base term instead of adding with multiplication
   $${x^a \over x^b} = x^{a-b}$$

2a. Note this rule as well which is related: $$x^{-b} = {1 \over {x^b}}$$

- NOTE: this rule does not always apply - it is true only when the two numbers are positive
  - If x is negative or b is negative, then the rule does not hold

3. $$(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$$

### Natural Log rules

### These rules/properties are true as long as `a` and `b` are GREATER THAN 0

- Note: $\ln$ = Natural Logarithm

4. $$\ln(a \times b) = \ln(a) + \ln(b)$$
5. $$\ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)$$
6. $$\ln({a \over b}) = \ln(a) - \ln(b)$$
