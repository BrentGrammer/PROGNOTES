## Deformation

- Primary Forces:
  - Stress: the force acting
  - Strain: the deformation result from the Stress

- Folds can occur with pressure over long periods of time (Anticlines) (Ductile)
  - Over sufficiently long times, Brittle breakage can occur
  - Slow lighter pressure = Ductile (folds)
  - Faster stronger pressure = Brittle (breaks/fractures)

## Stress and Strain

- Stress: force vectors on rock surfaces or planes within a rock
  - Measured as force vectors on a plane which can be oriented infinitely different ways across a rock material
  - Should be thought of as a ratio of force to an area on the rock (allows for small points to be measured better)
  - Force vectors can vary across different parts of the rock in magnitude and direction
  - "Shear": a sideways stress instead of top-down vertical stress
- Strain: fracture and breakage from Stress
  - Often consists of microfractures that accumulate

- Stress can pass through different regions
  - Example sandstone: Grains, Grain boundaries, Air pockets/pores, Boundary of an air pore and a grain boundary
