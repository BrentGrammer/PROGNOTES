# Design Principles

## Program to an Interface, not an Implementation

- An "interface" does not literally mean a Java Interface, for example, it means a supertype in general of some sort.
  - This could be an abstract class or an Interface, etc.
- The declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects assigned to those variables can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesnâ€™t have to know about the actual object types

```java
// BAD: programming to a concrete implementation:
Dog d = new Dog(); // Dog is a concrete implementation, forces us to code against it's implementation, it's specific methods, etc.
d.bark();

// GOOD: programming to an interface
// type the dog as a higher level Animal interface
Animal animal = new Dog(); // now we can use Animal's high level methods that function as a stable public API, separating implementation from the interface
animal.makeSound(); // allows for polymorphism to change behavior

// BETTER: no reference to a concrete implementation, just get the interface:
a = getAnimal(); // don't know if it is a dog or what concrete implementation is involved at runtime
a.makeSound(); // program against the interface, could be any animal at runtime
```

## Favor Composition over Inheritance

- Use HAS-a relationships instead of IS-a relationships between objects and classes.
  - Objects can have a certain behavior injected instead of inheriting it from a super class, for example.
    - see [Strategy Pattern](./CleanCoders-Strategy.md)

- Do NOT create and use an object in the same place.
  - Create the object outside of where it's used and pass the instance in as a dependency to where it is used to retain flexibility
